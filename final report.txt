Final Report â€“ Network Traffic Capture and Analysis

Objective:
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark, filter by protocol, and identify at least three different types of network communication.

Date of Capture: 11-Aug-2025
Tool Used: Wireshark v4.x

Protocols Identified
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Purpose: Facilitates the transfer of web content between browsers and web servers.
Observation: Captured GET and HTTP/1.1 response packets between local IP and remote web server, indicating normal web browsing activity.

DNS (Domain Name System)
Purpose: Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
Observation: Queries to a public DNS server (8.8.8.8) for domains such as google.com, followed by standard DNS response packets.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Purpose: Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data between applications.
Observation: Noted multiple three-way handshake sequences (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and normal TCP data transfer segments used by both HTTP and DNS traffic.

Summary of Findings
Total packets captured: 17857  over approximately one minute of monitoring.
The capture showed routine network behavior:

HTTP for web browsing,

DNS for hostname resolution,

TCP as the transport layer protocol.
All protocols displayed expected packet structures with no signs of errors or suspicious patterns.
This confirms a healthy and normal operational state of the network during the capture period.
